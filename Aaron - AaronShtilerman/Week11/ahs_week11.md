## ietestform results
Below are the results from the `ietestform` command on stata.

Non numeric name values: This was under the dataset implementation in the choices tab, so I think the error is excused.
No stata list labels: I didn't have stata labels in the choices tab, only in the survey tab. I updated the choices tab accordingly.
Spaces before or after string: This was a simple typo in one of my group definitions.
Required note type field: The cases where I used required notes were justified as they served as serious stopping points for the survey
