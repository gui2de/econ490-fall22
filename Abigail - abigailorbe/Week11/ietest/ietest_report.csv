TEST: NAME CONFLICT ACROSS REPEAT GROUP
----------------------------------------------------------------------

"There is a potential name conflict between field a field inside a repeat group with a field outside "
"the repeat group. When variables in repeat groups are imported to Stata they will be given the "
"suffix fieldname_1, fieldname_2 etc. for each repeat in the repeat group. It is therefore bad "
"practice to have a field name that share the name as a field in a repeat group followed by an "
"underscore and a number, no matter how big the number is. The potential conflicts are:"

"Repeat field [state_grades] on row 45 and field [state_grades_1] on row 42"
