My survey is designed to help golf clubs better do their service and marketing.

This is the updated version of the survey.

The users under case management attached to this survey begin with the id "victoria_", followed by a number 1 to 10; with the label "bp_user", followed by a number 1 to 10.

## ietestform results
Below are the results from the `ietestform` command on stata.

Non numeric name values: This was under the attached dataset "continent by continent" in the choices tab, so I don't think I can make any changes to this.
No stata list/field label: I have updated the choices tab accordingly.
End/begin name mismatch: I think this is because I have nested different smaller groups inside a larger one, thus I don't think I can make any changes to this.
Non-required non-note type field: The purpose of this question is to ask if people have spent time in the following activities above, how much time did they spend in those activities. Thus, if people spent 0 hour in shopping, then, he/she doesn't have to answer this question.
Required note type field: The cases where I used required notes were justified as they served as serious stopping points for the survey
Unused choice lists: I have removed such choices.
